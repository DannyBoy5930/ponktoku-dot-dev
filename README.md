## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build/) - A web framework for content driven websites with hybrid, static & server side rendering
- **UI**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Hosting**: [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/vercel) - A cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions

## ðŸš€ Design Notes

- Design and colours are inspired by [Hypergryph's](https://ak.hypergryph.com/#index) game [Arknights](https://www.arknights.global/).
- Content is split into two collections: `blog` and `notes`.
- Blog posts contain my insights on various topics (mainly non-technology related), while notes contain useful records and tutorials focused on development.
- The website has i18n (internationalization) functionality to toggle languages.
